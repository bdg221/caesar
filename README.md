# Caesar Cipher
This project implements a Caesar Cipher using Python's ard() and chr() functions. 

The ard() function takes a character and returns the integer associated with the ASCII character.
The chr() function does the inverse by taking an integer and returning the ASCII character.

The script expects the following format when being run from the command-line:
>python caesar.py [encode|decode] "Text to be modified" {optional shift integer}

To see the format or examples, the script can be run without any arguments.
